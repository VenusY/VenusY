## Hi there, I'm Venus Yip ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! I am a self-taught programmer with a curious mind who loves learning and building interesting projects! I have always loved a good challenge and am currently having fun dabbling in backend development and trying to master React.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a weather app called [Atmos](https://github.com/VenusY/atmos-weather-app)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, Node.js, Express.js, and API integration
